# firefighter_deaths_data

This is a project investigating on-duty deaths of United States firefighters, done in R. The goal for this project is to examine the top causes of on-duty deaths for firefighters, which will hopefully lead to an increased understanding of what can be done to reduce their risk for these causes.


The data was downloaded from the U.S. Fire Administration website. Additional information on inclusion criteria for the dataset was obtained from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) website.

The data include all types of firefighters including volunteer, career, military, and prisoners. The fatalities included in this research are those resulting from traumatic injury, heart attack, or stroke while victims were on duty or within 24 hours of duty.

Illnesses or medical conditions other than heart attacks or strokes are not included in the study. Deaths due to cancer are not included #in these data.

The data was downloaded from the U.S. Fire Administration website. It includes all recorded on-duty deaths from 1990-2022.
